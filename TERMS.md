# Terms of Service
Last updated: August 2023

Thank you for choosing Herodesk and using our Products to support your customer service heroes. Because we will be doing business together, we need to have some terms and conditions to regulate how that will work.

When we say "Company", "we", "us", or "our" in this document, we are referring to **Herodesk ApS** (CVR: DK-44196972).

When we say "Services" or "Products" (in singular or plural), we are referring to our websites and the Herodesk products.

When we say "Customer", "you", or "your", we are referring to the user, people or company that owns an account with us and are using our Services. When we say "Account" or "Subscription", we are referring to the instance of the Herodesk product that you have subscribed to.

Our Product is designed to help you give better customer service to your customers, so when we say "your customers", we are referring to the people who you will be communicating with using our Product.

Multiple people from the same organisation can use our Product. So when we say "user" or "users", we are referring to you or anyone of your colleagues or co-workers who is registered as a user in your Herodesk account and has their own login.

These terms of service (also referred to as "Terms") will be updated from time to time. You will be able to track changes on our website. Changes will usually be minor updates to clarify certain terms or expressions. However, if substantial changes are made, the timestamp at the top will be updated, and we will take appropriate steps to notify our customers.

These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and us. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by the latest version of these terms. While we aim for long-lasting relationships with all our customers based on mutual trust and cooperation, violation of these terms may result in us terminating your account.

## Account Terms
1.1. You must register an account with us as a legal business entity that you represent to use our services. A valid business name and email address is required to register an account with us.

1.2. When you register a new account with us, your e-mail address will automatically be subscribed to our product update email list, where important product and company updates will be sent out when we must. More frequent updates, the latest news from our company, commercial updates etc., will be shared via our regular newsletter, which you can subscribe to via our website.

1.3. You are responsible for securing your account with a strong password and ensuring that your users are doing the same. The Company cannot be held responsible or liable for any damages endured due to unsafe computing.

1.4. Every user is personal, which means that you are not allowed to share the same user with multiple people in your organization. Every person must have their own user to access your Herodesk account.

1.5. You are responsible for all activity and content that occurs in your account, including but not limited to activity by or content posted by you, your users or your customers.

1.6 You are responsible for complying with all relevant legislation applicable to your use of the Services and Products.

1.8. Herodesk reserves the right to suspend or terminate an account at any time and at our discretion without any notice, penalty or liability.

## Payments and Subscriptions
3.1. We offer a free version of Herodesk, and it is indeed free of charge. We will not ask for your credit card details, and you can keep using it for as long as you want.

3.2. If you are on a free trial of one of our paid Services ("Free Trial"), we will clearly explain when the Free Trial expires. After that, you must pay the applicable fees to continue to use our paid Services. Failure to do so will result in your account being suspended and later deleted (see our Cancellation terms for specifics).

3.3. You agree to pay the fees associated with your selected subscription plan on a pre-paid monthly or annual basis, as applicable. Refunds are handled according to our refund policy.

3.4. If you upgrade your subscription, we will charge you the intermediate price for the remainder of your billing period. Upon the next renewal, you will pay the full new price.

3.5. If you downgrade your subscription, the new price will be applied upon the next renewal. Intermediate differences will not be refunded, but you will be able to upgrade back to the previous level without any costs for the remaining billing period.

3.6. All payments must be made using a credit card. Credit cards are stored with a secure and PCI-compliant payment processor for future automatic payments.

3.7. Your subscription will be renewed and paid using your credit card automatically unless cancelled in accordance with our cancellation terms.

3.8. If our prices or fees ever change, we will announce the changes with reasonable notice, though never less than 30 days. By continuing your use of the Services after receiving a notice, you accept the adjusted fees and prices.

## Refunds
4.1. Our refund policies are based on fairness and in the spirit of playing fair. While we do not refund pre-paid subscriptions, the following circumstances will allow for a refund:

- You meant to cancel your account but forgot, so your subscription just got renewed, and you don’t intend to use the Services in the renewal period. We will grant you a full refund of the payment.


- You forgot to cancel your account some months ago and haven’t used it since. We’ll grant you a refund for the remaining billing period.


- If we have had extended downtime where our Services have been unavailable (meaning multiple hours in a day or multiple days in a month), we will grant you a partial refund based on a case-by-case evaluation and dialogue.


- If you contact our customer service and it takes us multiple days to reply, we will grant you a partial refund based on a case-by-case evaluation.

## Cancellation and Termination
5.1. It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to cancel their subscription if they wish so. Cancellation can only be done via the Service’s control panel. Cancellation requests sent to Herodesk in any other way are not valid and will not be considered as a cancellation.

5.2. If you fail to complete the payment for a renewal, your account will be suspended 7 days after the payment date. If the payment has still not been made, your account will be automatically cancelled and processed accordingly to 5.3.

5.3. When an account is cancelled, it will continue to operate until the end of the current billing period. Cancelled accounts are not automatically renewed. When the current billing period ends, a cancelled account will also be suspended and become inaccessible. The account will remain suspended for 30 days, during which time it can be re-activated by paying for a renewal. After 30 days, the account and all data associated with it will be irreversibly deleted. We may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.

5.4. Herodesk reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate an account without notice if its usage is not in accordance with our Terms or if the Customer breaches our Terms.

# Privacy Policy
Last updated: August 2023

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from our customers ("Customer," "you," or "your") when you visit our website or use our Herodesk products and services ("Services"). By using the Services, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that this Privacy Policy only concerns how we handle information about our Customers. Our Services are designed to help our Customers communicate with their customers. Thus, information about them will be processed and stored by us. In that regard, the Customer is the "data controller" or "business", and Herodesk ApS is to be considered a "data processor" or "service provider". Our obligations in that regard are not a part of this Privacy Policy.

If you are an end-user or customer of one of our Customers who are using our Services to facilitate their communication with you, and you have any questions regarding how your data is collected, stored or used, please contact the organization that has provided your information to us for more information.

Our guidelines for what information we collect are simple: We collect only information that we need, we treat it as personal information that should be treated with the highest level of confidentiality possible, and we delete it if or when we no longer need it.

## Information We Collect and Purpose
We may collect the following types of information:

**When visiting our website:** When you visit our websites, we collect non-personal information for statistical purposes or to improve our website and services.

**Personal Information:** When you register for our Services, we may collect personal information, such as your name, email address, billing information, and contact details.

**Customer Data:** As part of using the Services, you, your users or your customers may input data, files, and information into the system ("Customer Data"). This data is stored on our servers and processed only for the purpose of providing the Service and related services to you.

**Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you interact with the Service, such as log files, IP addresses, browser types, device information, and pages visited.

## How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information for the following purposes:

**Provision of Services:** We use your Personal Information and Customer Data to provide you with access to our Services and to fulfil your subscription.

**Customer Support:** We may use your information to respond to your inquiries, provide technical support, and resolve issues related to the Service.

**Improvement of Services:** We use usage data and feedback from customers to improve the functionality and user experience of the Services.

**Legal Compliance:** In certain cases, we may be required to use and retain your Personal Information to comply with legal obligations or to protect our rights and interests.

## Data Retention
We will retain your Personal Information and Customer Data only for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services and to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Once data is no longer needed, we will securely delete or anonymize it.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
We will under no circumstances sell, rent, or share your Personal Information with any third parties, except in the following circumstances:

**Service Providers:** We may engage third-party service providers to assist with software maintenance, payment processing, data storage, and other necessary services to enable us to deliver our Services to you. These providers are bound by confidentiality obligations and are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any other purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, any third-party service providers we use, who are based in the US, are actively listed in the Data Privacy Framework Program in accordance with the new EU-U.S. Data Protection Framework.

**Legal Compliance:** We may disclose your Personal Information if required by law or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, investigate potential violations, or comply with a legal process.

We will not use your name or brand in our marketing materials unless we have your explicit permission.

## Artificial Intelligence
Some of our Services are integrated with the systems, tools and services provided by OpenAI. We use these tools and services to build advanced features in our Services that require artificial intelligence, such as virtual assistants, text and conversation manipulation and analysis, and for creating autogenerated drafts, replies and autonomous chatbots.

When enabled, all data and information you or your customers submit to Herodesk may be sent to OpenAI using their API for analysis. Thus, we recommend that you familiarise yourself with OpenAI’s policies and that you and your customers do not submit sensitive or confidential information. OpenAI’s privacy policy can be viewed https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/.

## Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information and Customer Data from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Our security measures are both of technical and organizational nature, and these include encryption of data sent via the public Internet, encryption of sensitive data stored in our databases and backup procedures.

While all these measurements are in place, please understand that it is no guarantee as no data transmission over the Internet or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## Your Rights
You have the right to access, limit, correct, update, and delete your Personal Information and Customer Data. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below. You also have the right to complain to the Danish Data Protection Agency regarding the processing of your Personal Information.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website and updating the effective date.
